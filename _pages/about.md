I am a current **Ph.D. student at Cornell University** in the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) advised by [Professor Yunan Yang](https://as.cornell.edu/people/yunan-yang) and an [NDSEG](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/) fellow. My research is in operator learning, inverse problems, and SciML. I am currently working on designing optimal training data distributions which minimize out-of-distribution error with applications in radiative transport, electrical impedance tomography, geothermal energy extraction, and carbon storage.

In 2023, I graduated from Northwestern University with a Bachelor and Master of Science in Applied Mathematics and Bachelor of Music in Viola Performance. During my time at Northwestern, I conducted research with [Professor Melville Ulmer](https://physics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core-faculty/melville-ulmer.html) in the Department of Physics and Astronomy on a variety of projects, from transient phenomena and exoplanet detection to measuring surface roughness of telescopes.

In my free time, I like learning new languages, traveling, and playing my viola, which you can see on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFvHpRq2CeAYqGrJvhR-iA).
